# Filters

This feature is basically for developers.

You can define a Filter for each format which is applied to the text generated by Create Link.
Filters are defined with JavaScript code which takes generated text and returns text.

|Name|Format|Filter|
|----|------|------|
|HTML|<a href="%url%">%title%</a>|return s + ' ' + (new Date().toJSON().substring(0, 10))|

The configuration above gives you following text.

```html
<a href="http://example.com/">Example Domain</a> 2017-03-14
```
